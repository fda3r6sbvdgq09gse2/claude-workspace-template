# .ai/meta/ - Meta-Level Knowledge

**Purpose:** Capture learnings from projects to improve the framework and template.

**This is where knowledge compounds.**

---

## 🎯 Overview

This directory implements the **Knowledge Compounding System** - a meta-framework for continuous improvement.

```
Your Project → Learnings → Framework v2.0 → Better Next Project → More Learnings → v3.0...
```

## 📝 How to Use This System

### After Completing a Project

#### Step 1: Document Learnings (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Copy template
cp .ai/meta/learnings/TEMPLATE.md .ai/meta/learnings/2025-10-your-project.md

# Fill it out
vim .ai/meta/learnings/2025-10-your-project.md

# What to document:
# - What worked well
# - Pain points
# - New patterns discovered
# - Metrics
# - Recommendations
```

#### Step 2: Extract Patterns (30 minutes)

```bash
# For each new pattern discovered:
cat > .ai/meta/patterns/your-pattern.md <<'EOF'
# Pattern Name

## Problem
[What problem does this solve?]

## Solution
[Your solution]

## Code Example
[Working code]

## When to Use
[Use cases]

## Reusability
HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
EOF
```

#### Step 3: Write Proposals (1 hour)

```bash
# What should change in framework v2.0?
vim .ai/meta/proposals/framework-v2-enhancements.md

# What should change in template v2.0?
vim .ai/meta/proposals/template-v2-improvements.md
```

#### Step 4: Share with Framework Maintainer

```bash
# If you're the maintainer:
# - Review proposals
# - Implement changes
# - Tag new version

# If you're a user:
# - Open GitHub issue with proposals
# - Link to your learning documents
# - Contribute patterns back
```

## 🎓 Learning Document Guidelines

### What Makes a Good Learning Document?

✅ **DO:**
- Be specific (not "API integration was hard" but "Calling 5 APIs sequentially took 2x expected time")
- Include code examples
- Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Propose solutions
- Share metrics

❌ **DON'T:**
- Be vague ("framework could be better")
- Complain without solutions
- Include sensitive/proprietary information
- Skip the "What Worked Well" section

### Template Structure

Every learning document should have:

1. **Project Summary** - What you built
2. **What Worked Well** - Celebrate successes
3. **Pain Points** - What was hard (with severity)
4. **New Patterns** - What you discovered
5. **Metrics** - Quantify the experience
6. **Recommendations** - Specific improvement proposals

---

## 🎨 Pattern Documentation Guidelines

### What Makes a Pattern Reusable?

A good pattern:
- Solves a common problem
- Has been used 2-3+ times successfully
- Is generic (not project-specific)
- Has clear code examples
- Explains when to use it

### Pattern Template

```markdown
# Pattern Name

## Problem
[One sentence: what problem does this solve?]

## Context
[When does this problem occur?]

## Solution
[Your solution approach]

## Code Example
[Working, tested code]

## Variations
[Alternative approaches]

## When to Use
- Use Case 1
- Use Case 2
- Use Case 3

## When NOT to Use
- Anti-pattern 1
- Anti-pattern 2

## Reusability Rating
HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW

## Related Patterns
- [[pattern-1.md]]
- [[pattern-2.md]]

## 📊 Improvement Proposal Guidelines

### Framework Enhancement Proposal

**Structure:**

```markdown
# Framework v2.0 Enhancement Proposal

## Summary
[One-paragraph overview]

## Motivation
[Why is this needed?]

## Proposed Changes
[Specific changes to make]

## Examples
[Before/after code]

## Impact Analysis
- Who benefits: [users/maintainers/both]
- Breaking changes: [yes/no]
- Effort estimate: [hours/days]
- Priority: [critical/high/medium/low]

## Alternatives Considered
[What else did you consider?]

## Implementation Plan
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
```

### Template Improvement Proposal

Same structure, but focused on template changes.

## 🔄 The Improvement Cycle

### Phase 1: Build (Weeks-Months)

**You are here:**
- Using current framework version
- Building your project
- Experiencing the framework

**Actions:**
- Keep notes of pain points
- Document patterns as you discover them
- Track what works well

### Phase 2: Capture (1-2 Days)

**After project completion:**
- Fill out learning document
- Extract patterns
- Write proposals

**Output:**
- `.ai/meta/learnings/your-project.md`
- `.ai/meta/patterns/*.md`
- `.ai/meta/proposals/*.md`

### Phase 3: Improve (1-2 Weeks)

**Framework maintainer:**
- Reviews all learnings
- Implements improvements
- Tags new version (v2.0)

**Result:**
- Framework v2.0 (better!)
- Template v2.0 (better!)

### Phase 4: Repeat

**Next project:**
- Start with v2.0 (already improved!)
- Build faster/better
- Capture new learnings
- → Framework v3.0

**Result:** Knowledge compounds infinitely

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### How to Know This Is Working

**Quantitative:**
- Development time decreases per project
- Code quality increases (coverage, types, docs)
- Framework adoption increases (GitHub stars, forks)
- Pattern library grows

**Qualitative:**
- Onboarding new team members is faster
- Fewer "how do I do X?" questions
- More "this was easy!" feedback
- Community contributions increase

---

## 🎓 Meta-Insights

### This System Is Self-Improving

**Why this works:**
1. Every project teaches us something
2. Learnings are captured systematically
3. Improvements are codified in framework/template
4. Next project benefits automatically
5. Repeat → Exponential improvement

### This System Is Open Source

**Share your learnings:**
- Open GitHub issues with proposals
- Contribute patterns back
- Help others learn from your experience

**Result:** Entire community gets better together
